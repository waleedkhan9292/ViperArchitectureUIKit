# ViperArchitectureUIKit

- There is no storyboard in this project. Interface depends on programatic views only. 
- Used Polymorphism concept in Api. 
- Implemented Viper architecture.
- Made base classes reduced the rewrite code and initialzers for each class.
- Made generic cells so now we donot need to write again and again datasource method of tableview(cellforrow) for each cell.
